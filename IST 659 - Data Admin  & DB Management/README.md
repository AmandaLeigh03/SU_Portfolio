Using SQL and MS Access, I recreated a database used in the Logistics Department.  This database is used to collect and store data on mail tendered to third part vendors.

Disclaimer 1: All data has been recreated as to not reveal company information.
Disclaimer 2: This is a simplified version of the live database, and is not an acurate representation of company technology

Recreated source data can be found in the Excel file
