# SU_Portfolio
This repository highlights the work I've done in the Syracuse Applied Data Science Master's Program.  This program was completed in June 2022.

Each folder has the work for the respective classes I've decided to showcase.  All source data can either be found within the folder, linked in the project itself, or within the README.md
